## Build for production

Configure the deployment path for the build with in [package.json](package.json) in this directory.
Currently it is set to `"homepage": "/ruleset-generator/"` to meet the zgif.org requirements.

From this directory run: `npm run build` to get the build artefact in /build.

## Usage

### Limitations

- This application breaks if the XSD is invalid; e.g. in http://zgif.org/api/ruleset/subset_52.xsd there's no `Account`.
- It's not possible to download with the mocked API
- It's not possible to consume the live API locally unless CORS is disabled in your browser. On Chrome you can achieve that by using [this extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en). _Note that you should the extension disables a good security feature of Google Chrome, don't forget to disable the extension after using it._

For a full list of features that are yet to be done, please refer to our `TODO.md` file.

### Instructions

1.  Paste or type a URL pointing to a zgif XSD that should be used as base. E.g. http://zgif.org/api/ruleset/dummy_ruleset.xsd
2.  Change the rule values: core, optional, not
3.  Optionally add new field or entity rules
4.  Click the button "generate ruleset" at the end of the page
5.  A new XSD should be downloaded

## Optional configuration

The app is by default connected to the live API.
Some API endpoints mocks are available for faster development and can be enabled by changing the file `src/config.js`.

Tests and support to other browsers require the addition of polyfills and may be done in the future.
